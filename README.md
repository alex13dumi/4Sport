# 4Sport
This repository contains an Android project that aims to make people do more sports. You can invite people and play different sports outside. This is a BETA stage of it. Main language is Java and for storing the data we used SQL.

Prerequisites for running:
* Android Studio
* phpMyAdmin

I would like to thank Vlad Calincu who worked with me.
